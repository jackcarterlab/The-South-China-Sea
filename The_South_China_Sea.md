## **1. The Claimants**

## **1.1: Competing Claims**

Expressed as claim clashes in 2021. A territorial claim clash refers to
an area in which one party’s territorial claim overlaps with that of
another. *(Council on Foreign Relations, 2020)*.

The data shows that there are multiple competing claims involving many
parties. It also shows how China and Taiwan have the highest number of
claim clashes, reflecting their ambitious “nine dash” line in which they
claim between 80% and 90% of the South China Sea territory.

 

## **1.2: Asymmetric Power**

Expressed as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population in 2019. GDP
refers to the total sum of goods and services produced at purchasers
prices. Population refers to all residents in a given country *(World
Bank, 2020)*.

The data shows that China has a significantly larger GDP and population
compared to Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei
combined. This suggests that China has substantially greater power vis a
vis its smaller neighbors.
