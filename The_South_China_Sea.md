## **1. The Claimants**

### **1.1: Asymmetric Power**

The data shows a significantly larger population, GDP and military
spending for China compared to Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan
and Vietnam. This suggests that China has far greater power over its
smaller neighbors.

Â 

### **1.2: Rising Military Spending**

Expressed as total military spending in USD from 1990 to 2019. Military
spending refers to current and capital expenditures on the armed forces,
including peacekeeping forces, defense ministries and other government
agencies engaged in defense projects *(World Bank, 2020)*.

The data shows a sharp increase in military spending for China between
1990 and 2019. It also shows how insignificant the spending increases of
others have been in comparison to that of their large neighbor. It
should be noted that time series data for Taiwan is unavailable.
